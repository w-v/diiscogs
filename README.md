web app for browsing the discogs.com database

The final project can be seen [here](http://diiscogs.w-v.fr)

## Intro
  This is a school project I did for a datastructure module during the 2nd year of my Computer Science degree.
  
  [discogs.com](https://discogs.com) is a user-created database of music releases (albums, singles, EPs, etc.)
  The database is available in xml (over 30GB) and has over 350m entries.
  
  The projects' goal was to import it in a MySQL database and build a web app for browsing it.
